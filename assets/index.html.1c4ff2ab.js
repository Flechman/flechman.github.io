My name is R\xE9mi Delacourt, I'm a Research Engineer at Mistral AI in Paris, France. At the moment, my main focus is on Large-scale Machine Learning Systems. I help design the best models in the world given hardware- and system-level constraints, and then maximize their speed and efficiency. This is an exciting topic, as the algorithmic and systems sides are tied together! If you want to discuss, I'd be happy to exchange on current, new, or upcoming technologies and their impact on the world with you!
