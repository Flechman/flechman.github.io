Hi! My name is Rémi Delacourt, I'm a Research Engineer at Mistral AI in Paris, France. At the moment, my main focus is on Large-scale Machine Learning Systems. I aim to train and serve LLMs faster and more efficiently. This is an exciting topic, as the algorithmic and systems sides are tied together!
If you want to discuss, I'd be happy to exchange on current, new, or upcoming technologies and their impact on the world with you! You can shoot me an email at [remi.delacourt@gmail.com](mailto:remi.delacourt@gmail.com) anytime.
