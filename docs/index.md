Hi! My name is Rémi Delacourt, I'm a final year CS Master's student at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. At the moment, my main focus is on Systems for Machine Learning, more specifically LLM Serving Systems. I aim at serving LLMs faster and with less resources. This is an exciting topic, as the algorithmic and systems sides are very tied together!
If you want to discuss, I'd be happy to exchange on current, new, or upcoming technologies and their impact on the word with you! You can shoot me an email at [remi.delacourt@gmail.com](mailto:remi.delacourt@gmail.com) anytime.
