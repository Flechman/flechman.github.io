# Distributed Algorithms
* These notes are not lecture notes!
* They are notes that summarize the specifications, properties and pseudo-code of the main distributed algorithms used in industry, from a theoretical point of view (i.e. we look at the existence of these algorithms, not their efficiency).
* These notes may help in developping the building blocks of communication in a distributed system.
* The order in which the algorithms are presented follow the one given in Rachid Guerraoui's Distributed Algorithms course at EPFL.
